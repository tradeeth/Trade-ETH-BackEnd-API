# TradeETH API

TradeETH's API gives you access to ticker information, orders, trades, deposits, withdrawals, and anything else available through our website. You can also interact directly with the smart contract to get trades, deposits, and withdrawals. For an example of directly working with the contract, take a look at our [contract_observer.py](https://github.com/tradeeth/backend-replacement/blob/master/app/services/contract_observer.py). TradeETH's orderbook is primarily stored offchain, but can be accessed with our public interface or through this API. To learn more about our order system, take a look at our [backend repository](https://github.com/tradeeth/backend-replacement).


# Websocket Server

TradeETH's API is socket.io based. The API utilizes SSL on all connections to keep your data private.
You can connect to TradeETH's API through this endpoint:

 - https://api.tradeeth.com

## Rate Limiting

Please try to limit your calls to the API to a reasonable frequency.

The API currently limits clients to 6 concurrent connections and 12 reconnects per minute per IP address. We reserve the right to adjust these without advanced notice.

The API does not limit the number of `getMarket` and `order` messages the client can send at this time. Protip: subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/tradeeth/proposals/issues/11) to get updates on when that changes.

Clients that violate rate limits repeatedly may be blocked.

## Best Practices
### Identify your client
Make sure to set a custom User Agent for your TradeETH API client whenever possible. The User Agent string should include the name and version of the client, as well as the client's homepage URL and author's contact (email), like so:

```
TradeETH Price Alerts by freeatnet (v0.1.5 (8b0aad6)) (https://project-homepage.com, freeatnet@freeatnet.com)
```

A custom User Agent string will allow us to reach out to you in case of any issues and will help us debug issues if you reach out for support.

### Backoff on errors
If you receive a one-off disconnect from the server, you may reconnect right away. However, if you receive multiple disconnects or receive errors when attempting to connect (HTTP statuses >=400), you must delay your next connection attempt. We recommend randomized [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) strategy: `retry_delay = min(((2^n)+random_number_milliseconds), 128)`, where `n` is the retry attempt count, starting at 0.

## Requests

There are two messages you can send to the TradeETH websocket API:
1. getMarket
2. message

### 1) getMarket ( token, user )

**getMarket** accepts two optional parameters: token & user.
- `token` is the Ethereum address for the token you wish to receive data on.
- `user` is the Ethereum wallet address for the user you wish to receive data on.

When `getMarket` is emitted, a `market` response will be returned.

The **market** response can consist of 6 different parts:

#### returnTicker

This is standard `returnTicker` information including volume and price data.

Example `returnTicker`:
```
{  
   "ETH_0x1183f92":{  
      "tokenAddr":"0x1183f92a5624d68e85ffb9170f16bf0443b4c242",
      "quoteVolume":"0",
      "baseVolume":"0",
      "last":"0.0006200000002",
      "bid":"0.00062",
      "ask":"0.001428",
      "updated":"2018-02-21T17:26:11.686344"
   },
   "ETH_0x11f8dd7":{  
      "tokenAddr":"0x11f8dd7699147566cf193596083d45c8f592c4ba",
[...]
```
If you would like to get data on each ticker including names, please take a look at our [tokenbase repository](https://github.com/tradeeth/tokenbase). If you would just like a simple way to access ticker symbols, take a look at our [configuration JSON](https://tradeeth.github.io/config/main.json).

We also supply a REST version of this data, but highly recommend using the websocket server for the most up to date information. The REST version can be found here: https://api.tradeeth.com/returnTicker

#### trades | myTrades

If `user` is passed in, `myTrades` will contain all trades available for the passed in user's address.
If `user` is not passed in, `myTrades` will be absent.

#### myFunds

If `user` is passed in, `myFunds` will contain deposits and withdrawals for the passed in user's address.
If `user` is not passed in, `myFunds` will be absent.

Example `myFunds`:
```
[
  { txHash: '0x295f173773f31c852a9c3eef252f8600620147c6aabb312276f8b0d9800cbc7a',

      amount: '0.001',
      balance: '0.005688612160935313' },
  ...
]
```

### 2) message ( order )

`message` allows you to post an order directly to TradeETH and accepts one required parameter.

`order` must be a properly formatted JSON object containing the following properties:
- `amountGive`: the amount you want to give (in wei or the base unit of the token)
- `tokenGive`: the token you want to give (use the zero address, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for ETH)
- `amountGet`: the amount you want to get (in wei or the base unit of the token)
- `tokenGet`: the token you want to get (use the zero address, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for ETH)
- `contractAddr`: the smart contract address
- `expires`: the block number when the order should expire
- `nonce`: a random number
- `user`: the address of the user placing the order
- `v`, `r`, `s`: the signature of sha256(contractAddr, tokenGet, amountGet, tokenGive, amountGive, expires, nonce) after being signed by the user

 On error, emits a `messageResult` event to the originating sid with an array payload, containing:
1. Error code:
   - `400` if the event payload could not be interpreted due to client error (cf. https://httpstatuses.com/400)
   - `422` if the event payload contained semantic errors (cf. https://httpstatuses.com/422)
2. A string error message with a brief description of the problem.
3. An object containing some useful details for debugging.

Example error result:
```
[
	422,
	"Cannot post order because it has already expired",
	{ "blockNumber": 5131620, "expires": 5131666, "date": 2017-10-17T17:36:41.000Z }
]
```
   
On success, emits a `messageResult` event to the originating sid with an array payload, containing:
1. Success code `202`: the order has been accepted.
2. A brief message confirming success

Example success result:
`[202, "Good job!"]`



## Events

### orders
New orders will be emitted as they are placed. The data structure of this `orders` event mirrors that of `market.orders` outlined above. However, some orders will have a `deleted` flag. Orders with the `deleted` flag have been cancelled or traded and are no longer valid.

### trades
New trades will be emitted as they occur. The data structure of this `trades` event mirrors that of `market.trades` outlined above.

### funds
New deposits and withdrawals will be emitted as they occur. The data structure of this `funds` event mirrors that of `market.myFunds` outlined above.


# API Client Libraries

Below is a (possibly incomplete) list of third-party libraries that can help you work with TradeETH API:

* **PHP:** [tradeeth-api-wrapper](https://github.com/chetcuti/tradeeth-api-wrapper) by @chetcuti
* **Python:** [etherdelta](https://github.com/miguelmota/py-etherdelta) by @miguelmota offers TradeETH client as an option

These are third-party libraries; as such, TradeETH has no control over them and offers no support for them. You should review their source code to make sure they are bug-free, safe, secure, and fit for your use.

If you would like to add your library to this list, let us know by opening an issue.
